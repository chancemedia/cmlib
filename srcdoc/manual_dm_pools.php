 * All data pools work on a simple key-value pair, where the key must be unique, when you set a
 * value to a key that already exists the value is replaced with the new value.
 * 
 * The values attached to the keys can be numerical, strings, arrays or objects. In fact, any type
 * that PHP supports. While it's possible to use non-string keys it is not recommended or supported.
